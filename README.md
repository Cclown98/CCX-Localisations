# CCX Localisations
Translations for CCX

Fork this repository and create a new folder with the name language.lproj where language is the language code (list below).

Eg: en-GB.lproj.

<h1>Do not remove the "\n"</h1>

<h3>Example:</h3>

    <dict>
        <key>DARK_MODE_ON</key> <-- DO NOT TRANSLATE
        <string>Dark Mode: On</string> <-- TRANSLATE
    </dict>


Then once translated submit a pull request.
